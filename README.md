# Treasure Hunting in Ancient Egypt

The goal of our project is to recreate an archeological site in Ancient Egypt, roughly inspired by the Giza pyramid complex, trying to capture the distinct feel of this time period. To provide an incentive for exploration and experimentation with the controls, we scattered treasures across the map. In this way, the scene we designed can be experienced as a minigame: find all the hidden treasures in the map. The GUI includes a counter in order to track the number of treasures still missing.
